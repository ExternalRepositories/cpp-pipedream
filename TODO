# Bugs

- [ ] zip handling of references from pointers vs values from (temporary) optionals; this is currently "correct" in that it works as advertised, but *should* pass refs through were possible .. need a ref_or_value utility here.  Note collect for std::map is now fixed in prep for this.

# Needing added

- [ ] coroutine support?

# Fixes / improvements

- [ ] generalize regex and others more for wchar etc
- [ ] more complete testing
